      <p>
        I got a master in Evolutionary and Behavioral Ecology from Gothenburg
        University. I did my master's thesis on parasite mediated sexual
        selection, which meant measuring the color saturation of the Southern
        Red Bishop's feathers and comparing that to it's parasite load.
