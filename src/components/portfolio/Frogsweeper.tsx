      <p>
        This game is being made as a present for a friend who likes Minesweeper
        and frogs. It is not currently finished, but, while ugly, it is sort of
        playable. The next step is to make gameplay a bit more easy and to add
        pretty artwork of frogs, curtesy of my brother.
